                    I'm a project coordinator at TechChange, based out of Washington, D.C. At TechChange, I design and develop trainings for non-profits and NGOs. I've re-designed our website, course platform, and user account pages. I've also coordinated the development of several trainings on topics such as Malaria Diagnosis, HIV/AIDS Patient Management, Teaching Literacy, and Incorporating Women into Conflict Resolution Efforts.

                    Outside of work, I attend the CodeforDC meetup, as well as the AngularJS meetups. I also enjoy camping and long-distance running.
