		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife and I went to Japan for our honeymoon. We were lucky to be able to take several weeks off work to completely disconnect. Every day, I wrote in a small journal with a tiny travel pen about what we did, where we went, and what we saw. Necessary so that we can re-live the details in a few years, but admittedly about as interesting as a convenience store receipt. More than what we saw and did, I wanted to talk a bit about what we felt on our trip.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;travel-is-anxiety&quot;&gt;Travel is Anxiety&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#travel-is-anxiety&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: travel-is-anxiety&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received our first dose an hour into our flight to Tokyo when our pilot, with a moderated urgency blurted, &amp;quot;Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts immediately.&amp;quot; Flight attendants scurried down both aisles asking, &amp;quot;Police or military?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an alarming first. I&#x27;ve heard calls for medical personnel frequently on international flights. But military? Our minds immediately jumped to hijacking or some high-profile crime in progress. Whispers circulated throughout the cabin. There was a fight in the back of the aircraft. Would we turn around?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, an extremely drunk passenger was subdued by the relief pilots. Anxiety gone. The pilot keyed on the mic to say, &amp;quot;Well, I know there are a lot of pilots taking care of an issue in the back of the plane, but I just wanted to let you know we still have a crew flying.&amp;quot; Cue laughs, and a collective exhale from the 400 people on board.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Assaulting a flight attendant is a great travel hack to be first off an airplane... in police custody.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will our transit passes work at the subway turn-style? Will this restaurant be good? Will we get hypothermia in the mountains of Kamikochi? Anxiety often came in short spurts. It&#x27;s a burden that adds contrast to memories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;flow-fast-and-slow&quot;&gt;Flow, Fast and Slow&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#flow-fast-and-slow&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: flow-fast-and-slow&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Japan in particular, our anxiety was quickly relieved by things that just worked. Transit, food, hotels, shopping were all seamless. We&#x27;d venture down into a subway station onto waiting trains and be whisked off to another part of the city. Restaurant closed? There&#x27;s another one that&#x27;s at least as good in the same building just a few floors up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling of rush, or flow in the cities of Japan was entirely new to me. At times, Tokyo felt like a massive, technicolor play scape. Instead of chutes and ladders you ride escalators and trains. In the station, down the escalator, wait at the right subway door, board the line, watch as stations dash by, exit at 2A, and you&#x27;re at the best tempura meal of your life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy to spend entire days just walking and exploring Tokyo in this flow state. Whether down a quiet back street or through the bustling Shibuya scramble, we felt an ease and distinct current to the city&#x27;s life. I left Tokyo feeling I could return a hundred more times and never see enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the countryside, the flow of life slowed considerably. We trekked between towns on trails that were hundreds of years old. Still, when we were tired of walking there was always a train nearby to take us to our next town.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;quiet-surprises&quot;&gt;Quiet Surprises&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#quiet-surprises&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: quiet-surprises&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many people we met were subtly charming. There&#x27;s the sushi chef who saw that I was left-handed and re-arranged my order. There&#x27;s the bike shop owner who rushed out to give us stickers and ask where we were from after he noticed us taking a photo in front of his store. One Okonomiaki chef welcomed us graciously despite not speaking a word of English and treated us to an incredible meal in the restaurant she&#x27;d owned for 33 years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed at several traditional Ryokans and marveled at the sweets the left in our rooms and even moreso at the meals they served. We walked down stone paths to secluded onsen pools and marveled at their steaming serenity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed to be the way: ride bustling trains and busses to a small shrine on the outskirts of Kyoto and find surprise at the silence. Meander through a busy train station and duck into a quiet ramen shop with the most sumptuous noodles imaginable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;time-together&quot;&gt;Time Together&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#time-together&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: time-together&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a feeling of satisfaction in spending quality time with the person you love. We we&#x27;re deeply happy on many parts of this trip. In particular, the 2-hour multi-course meals set the scene for conversations about everything and nothing in particular. Each dish we ate was worthy of an entire conversation in and of itself. The new context made me reflect on how rushed out life back in the U.S. was. How sometimes in our day-to-day week we eat semi-silently over our dinners. More than anything I hope to keep those memories as a reference through the rest of our lives together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Low Gear Thinking</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re any good, at some point in your career you’ll be asked to solve an annoying, soul-crushing, complex problem. The problem itself is unlikely to be glamorous or involve any kind of mental trickery. In my career, the truly difficult problems have involved a few common elements:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy systems&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple integrations&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disparate teams&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expiring data&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-a-story&quot;&gt;First, a Story&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#first-a-story&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: first-a-story&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, I was asked to help a Twilio customer obtain telephone numbers in South Sudan for a hotline. Twilio itself didn’t have numbers in South Sudan – it’s a relatively small market and likely not worth the complexity to onboard. However, we were able to integrate with other carriers that did have a presence via Session Initial Protocol (SIP).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIP is a standardized protocol, but there are nuances to what features are supported depending on the underlying hardware. One of the major issues we encountered was that Twilio’s platform uses a highly dynamic IP range and relies on SIP authentication to prove that we’re the ones placing the call. In contrast, some of the infrastructure we were working with expected a static IP address and didn’t work with the authentication method we could provide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls quickly spiraled in complexity. For one, it was difficult to find someone who knew how the carrier’s IP-PBX configuration worked. Details were to be submitted in a spreadsheet and would be configured several weeks later. Then, there was the matter of testing. We needed to have someone on-the-ground in South Sudan (a relief worker) actually place test calls. Every call we wanted to test relied on scheduling 6 people across 4 timezones, nearly at 90 degree angles to one another around the earth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-did-we-learn&quot;&gt;So what did we learn?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-did-we-learn&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-did-we-learn&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing is to break down the problem. I call this low-gear thinking. Like riding a bike up a steep hill with small easy pedal strokes, you will sometimes need to break down complex problems. I’d recommend two specific ways to do this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, build a ladder diagram for yourself:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label each system involved&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document each system’s respective inputs and outputs&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create connections that show what is communicated between each system&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If relevant, note the timings between each action within the system&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LucidChart has a good explainer on how to use a ladder diagram. My preference is to actually write one in UML rather than build one graphically. At first, don’t worry about grouping the systems or legibility. Just document everything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an emotional reason to do a ladder diagram first. Complex problems spark fear and anxiety, and completing a wrote task up front will build confidence. It’s also a great way to get your brain passively thinking about the problem. Once you feel you have a solid foundation representing, you can start cleaning things up. In some cases it makes sense to split a ladder diagram across multiple diagrams, particularly if there are more than 4 systems involved. At that point, you could be doing a lot of horizontal scrolling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to actually make a public-facing version of your ladder diagram, most likely a process map. Your process map should be simple enough that it can be explained in 3-5 minutes. You may need multiple depending on your audience. The purpose of the process map is to create clarity for the different teams involved in solving your problem. When you think about a problem for hours at a time, it is extremely easy to leave others behind. A good process diagram will help everyone involved understand at a glance how their system relates to the problem you’re solving for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;speed-solves-all-problems&quot;&gt;Speed Solves All Problems&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#speed-solves-all-problems&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: speed-solves-all-problems&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you think you have an understanding of the systems involved – what next? Run a test and see if you’re able to solve the problem. It probably won’t work out the first time. There are then two improvements to make: figure out what things can be run in parallel, and figure out how to make test tasks faster.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinating a team of 5+ people to meet and test a system is frankly difficult to do more than once a week. Of course, if all parties are highly motivated you can stay on a conference bridge for as long as it takes to solve the problem. But most of the time coordination will be difficult. As a result, you’ll need to look at ways to keep the number of people down. In South Sudan, we were able to find a way to test an incoming call without having a person on-the-ground call-in. One less timezone!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolating system components is also a great path to increasing testing speed. To do this successfully however, you’ll need to know precisely what you need to get out of tests for each system. Again in South Sudan, we ended up adding a SIP proxy middleware layer that connected calls to the contact center using the authentication that Twilio required. This part we were able to test on its own, while call-path testing from South Sudan remained a separate setup process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, pay attention to what’s working for communication between the parties involved. Some people thrive on calls while others write well. Still others simply might not be good communicators. A team’s ability to solve a problem frequently comes down to the collective data transfer bandwidth (written, verbal) that can be attained. If someone doesn’t speak your language, find a translator. That may seem like a tall order, but it’s going to be far easier than struggling through repetitive two-ships-passing-in-the-night meetings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Running My First Marathon</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finished! Running a Marathon was the ultimate &amp;quot;small improvements over time lead to big results&amp;quot; event. I never really thought I&#x27;d have the endurance to complete a 26.2 mile course, but a year plus of running consistently made it very doable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I distinctly remember finishing a half marathon and not being able to imagine running further. But then I kept my long runs at 13.1 miles, and started to push beyond that. At a certain point, 13.1 became my warm up – the real run was everything beyond.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I realized I could actually finish this race was during my last long run. I almost didn&#x27;t do it. I woke up at 6am on a Saturday morning to run 21 miles through the Berkeley hills, down by the waterfront. There was a moment in bed where I nearly went back to sleep. But as soon as I was in my shoes, I knew I could make it. Running through the golden hills at sunrise was the best prize of my entire training.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot more about my body while training for this race. I learned about how muscle imbalance can cause knee pain. I learned how back pain can manifest as leg pain. I learned how to stretch. I learned how to strike forward on my foot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I thought of running as an incredibly boring sport. But when you start focusing and discover the myriad fine-tuning adjustments you can make to breath, foot position, posture, cadence, running becomes endlessly fascinating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several runners I chatted with at the finish line were saying &amp;quot;never again!&amp;quot; with a big grin on their faces. Perhaps once is enough for some, but I don&#x27;t think this will be my last marathon. Running a major race like Chicago would be an incredible experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
