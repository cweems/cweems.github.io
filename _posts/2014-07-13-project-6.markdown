description: I worked with Code for DC to create a web application that helps users determine whether or not they are eligible to clear their criminal records. My favorite part of this project was getting to work with people with diverse skillsets ranging from law, to user experience, to organizing. My specific contributions to the project included seting up the application's routing system, refactoring the application into views, and creating the overall look for the UI.
