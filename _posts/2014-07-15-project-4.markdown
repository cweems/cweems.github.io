description: As a Project Coordinator at TechChange, I worked with the Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center in San Francisco to create an online course for doctors, nurses, and volunteers who help people living with HIV/AIDS. The course is accredited to provide healthcare practitioners with continuing education credits in the State of California. To date, more than 400 individuals have taken the course.
