description: TechChange's course platform has served as an online classroom for more than 5000 alumni from 100+ countries. For this project, I updated the look and feel of the course platform to match the TechChange website and accounts page to ensure a consistent user experience. One of my favorite additions here was a loading screen, which made for a more graceful loading experience for our users in low-bandwidth locations.
