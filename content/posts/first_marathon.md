I finished! Running a Marathon was the ultimate "small improvements over time lead to big results" event. I never really thought I'd have the endurance to complete a 26.2 mile course, but a year plus of running consistently made it very doable.

About six months ago I distinctly remember finishing a half marathon and not being able to imagine running further. But then I kept my long runs at 13.1 miles, and started to push beyond that. At a certain point, 13.1 became my warm up – the real run was everything beyond.

The moment I realized I could actually finish this race was during my last long run. I almost didn't do it. I woke up at 6am on a Saturday morning to run 21 miles through the Berkeley hills, down by the waterfront. There was a moment in bed where I nearly went back to sleep. But as soon as I was in my shoes, I knew I could make it. Running through the golden hills at sunrise was the best prize of my entire training.

I learned a lot more about my body while training for this race. I learned about how muscle imbalance can cause knee pain. I learned how back pain can manifest as leg pain. I learned how to stretch. I learned how to strike forward on my foot.

Previously, I thought of running as an incredibly boring sport. But when you start focusing and discover the myriad fine-tuning adjustments you can make to breath, foot position, posture, cadence, running becomes endlessly fascinating.

Several runners I chatted with at the finish line were saying "never again!" with a big grin on their faces. Perhaps once is enough for some, but I don't think this will be my last marathon. Running a major race like Chicago would be an incredible experience.
