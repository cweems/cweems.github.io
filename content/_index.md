Hi, I'm Charlie.

I'm a Solutions Architect at Twilio where I help customers integrate APIs for SMS, Voice, and Email. Outside of work I enjoy running, biking, and camping. I live in Berkeley, California with my wife and two dogs. I don't spend much time on social media, but if you'd like to chat feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-weems/).

I joined Twilio in 2018 as one of the first technical hires on Twilio.org. From 2018-2019 I focused on launching Twilio's Salesforce integration for nonprofits (and now all customers).

During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I worked with many of Twilio's nonprofit and government customers on differing projects such as contact centers for contact tracing, and the national vaccine finder short code.

Recently, I've been working on Twilio's Retail team where I help some of our largest customers communicate better with their customers.

Before Twilio I worked at Code for America. Getting picked as a 2016 fellow was a dream come true, and I was lucky to be asked to stay on contract after my fellowship. During my time at CfA, I had the change to work with San Diego and New York City on several different civic tech projects.

Before Code for America, I had dipped my toes into the tech-for-good world while working at TechChange in Washington, D.C. TechChange is an online education startup that builds training courses for government and nonprofits. For example, we partnered with Malaria Consortium to build one of the first computer-based training courses for pharmacists in Uganda and Nigeria.

I found TechChange through a social event thrown by USAID for nonprofits and public benefit corporations working in international development. I had been with USAID since graduating from college both as an employee and a contractor.

I went to Whitman College where I studied Politics. I'm originally from Amherst Massachusetts where I grew up as the son of a professor and a librarian.
